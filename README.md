A console for Swift Playgrounds

Code from a blog post: https://damian.fyi/2020/07/01/ipad_swift_playgrounds_console/

Copy the code from [Console.swift](Console.swift) into your file and then use `print` as normal, and then at the end examine the `console` variable's content. See the above blog post for more info.
